# Chapter 1: Binary and Logic Gates

In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of the binary number system and logic gates. Understanding these basics is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the workings of digital systems.

## Binary Number System

The binary number system is the foundation of digital systems. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, and forms the basis of all digital data representation.

### Binary Addition

One of the fundamental operations in the binary system is addition. Let's explore how binary addition works and its significance in digital computing.

## Logic Gates

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT, enabling the manipulation of binary data.

### AND Gate

The AND gate outputs true (1) only when both of its inputs are true (1). We'll dive into the truth table and practical applications of the AND gate.
