# Chapter 2: Sequential and Combinatorial Circuits

In this chapter, we'll build upon the basics covered in Chapter 1 and explore more advanced topics related to digital systems, including sequential and combinatorial circuits.

## Sequential Circuits

Sequential circuits involve the use of memory elements to store information. This chapter will cover flip-flops, registers, and how they contribute to the storage and processing of data in digital systems.

### Flip-Flops

Flip-flops are bistable multivibrators that store a single bit of data. We'll discuss various types of flip-flops and their applications in sequential circuits.

## Combinatorial Circuits

Combinatorial circuits, also known as combinational circuits, perform operations solely based on their input. There is no internal state, making them crucial for certain digital tasks.

### Multiplexers and Demultiplexers

Multiplexers are devices that select one of many input signals and route it to a single output. Demultiplexers perform the opposite operation. We'll explore their functionalities and use cases.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing Chapter 2! You've gained insights into the advanced components of digital systems. Feel free to revisit any section or explore further topics as needed.
